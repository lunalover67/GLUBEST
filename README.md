# GLUBEST (2025)
My annoying cats demand to be fed all the time, even when im not home! Luckily I engineered a systeme that allows me to watch and feed them from a website! Note: this is a protoype, the physical contraption is made of sticks and stones pretty much.

## tech stack
- AWS for global server
- Java for backend (agent and server logic)
- Web dev (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Arduino Uno R3 

## screenshots (beware there may be some cat photos included)

## features
- main menu with picture cycling and light music
- live camera feed: see the cats in real time!
- feed system: press the feed button which will relay a signal to the motor to turn and feed the cats
- both a desktop and a mobile ui (didnt include mobile ui screenshot but it looks sick)

## inspo
- cats come home to annoy me everyday after i get home from school, so i decided to feed them while im at school
- i had recently learned about http servers, but wanted to learn websockets
