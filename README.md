# GLUBEST (2025)
My annoying cats need to be fed all the time, even when im not home! Luckily I engineered a systeme that allows me to watch and feed them from a website! Note: this is a protoype, the physical contraption is made of sticks and stones pretty much.

## tech stack
- AWS for global server
- Java for backend (agent and server logic)
- Web dev (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Arduino Uno R3 

## screenshots (beware there may be some cat photos included)
